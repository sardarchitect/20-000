Even if the architect provides social space(s), the intrinsic nature of being self-sustaining (bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, etc. all being in the same unit), gives room to creating a very individualistic lifestyle. These separate living environments create social bubbles within the life of the inhabitants, which may or may not be desirable. Moreover, this individual unit system is low kinetic: the dynamics prescribed by a localized architecture (in terms of proximity of programs), is lower than, let\u2019s say, alternative ways of living.","By challenging this conventional configuration of a solid-void relationship between the public and private space within each residential unit, an alternative way of living environment can be cultivated.","Through exploding and fragmenting the programs (i.e. by deliberately shifting the programs of one unit in relation to others), and re-organizing the configuration of these individual programs, the architecture can allow room for social interaction, that may have not been possible otherwise. For example, the architecture may lead to unusual interactions between categories of people who normally wouldn\u2019t be able to directly interact with one another in the conventional sense.","Furthermore, by creating social spaces that double as utilitarian (such as common kitchen spaces, public baths, open living rooms, etc.), this idea of bumping into another member of this micro-community can be furthered. As noted above, conventional housing units are low dynamic in nature. They are almost inflexible to the changing social environments within the community. By providing the residents modular structures that can be added (both vertically and horizontally), subtracted, and moved, space can be generated according to the inhabitant\u2019s needs.","The site-less nature of the project allows an exploration of a public/private solid-void relationship, through a formal aesthetic. By carving into these fantastical mountainous plinths, a more permanent public/private relationship can be designed, which differentiates itself from the extremely social dynamic life on the surface."],images:["/project-gallery/fragmented-living/1.png","/project-gallery/fragmented-living/2.png"],thumbnailSrc:"/thumbnail/Plans_Sections_Axons-3-200x300.png"},{projectId:"4",title:"Phantasmagoria",year:"2020",text:["Studio: Peter Halquist","Phantasmagoria(noun): a sequence of real or imaginary images likethose seen in a dream.Through the use of curated reflectionsoverlayed onto a 3D space, it is possibleto lose sense of reality and perception.

This effect is bolstered by the proximity to the Eastern Market, and two other grocery stores in the area. If business appears to be bustling at one of the places and not the other, renters will have the opportunity to connect with these groups and sell their produce at these locations. The greenhouse in particular is designed without barriers between each unit. This can lead to a number of encounters amongst the two occupants which can lead to new friendships, knowledge, and potentially a helping hand.","Given the uninhibited quality of the greenhouse, it can adapt to the desires of the inhabitants quite easily.
