      `Wallenberg Award Finalists The rights of the Native Americans have been constantly violated since the first encounter with European colonists. Today, Native reservations are exploited for their land and resources for capitalistic gains, virtually erasing their influence and footprint from this continent. Indigenous people living on reservations are disproportionately experiencing problems of poverty, connectivity, housing, education, and overall self-determination.`,

In pursuit of addressing the socio-economic disparity and spatial issues within the Pueblos north of Albuquerque, this project aims to catalyze infrastructure development that creates the potential for new architectural configurations and urban dynamics.`,
      `Through navigating within law, policies, economic incentives, and the cultural context, the project proposes to create a unified Pueblo body, the Middle Rio Grande Pueblo Initiative, that advocates for Indigenous priorities to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  MRGPI works closely with lawyers, architects, and politicians to prioritize infrastructure development through budgetary allocations, and collective transformations. Simultaneously, the Initiative implements economically and environmentally sustainable spatial productions that all help create an inter-tribal economy. By doing so, the project speculates a decrease in heavy-dependency on the BIA, and an increase in tribal sovereignty`,

      `Farm-to-Rent is designed, at its core, with community in mind.`,
      `This program encourages using the provided infrastructure as a means for residents to not only feed themselves, but also their neighbor, friend, family, or a stranger. As long as one is willing to cultivate their produce, and there are people willing to purchase, a strong and healthy relationship can be fostered. This effect is bolstered by the proximity to the Eastern Market, and two other grocery stores in the area. If business appears to be bustling at one of the places and not the other, renters will have the opportunity to connect with these groups and sell their produce at these locations. The greenhouse in particular is designed without barriers between each unit. This can lead to a number of encounters amongst the two occupants which can lead to new friendships, knowledge, and potentially a helping hand.`,
      `Given the uninhibited quality of the greenhouse, it can adapt to the desires of the inhabitants quite easily. Simple negotiations with one’s neighbor regarding how much space they’d each like to use can determine how the greenhouse will be best used. Additionally, the program aims to increase communication between two traditionally conflicting groups - the landlord and the renter. Given that the program relies on a deductible from the landlord, in exchange for produce, means that ongoing conversations will be had so that both parties are satisfied, motivated and happy!`,

      `Conventional residential complexes contain self-centered units that usually inhibit any kind of interaction with other neighboring units. Even if the architect provides social space(s), the intrinsic nature of being self-sustaining (bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen, etc. all being in the same unit), gives room to creating a very individualistic lifestyle. These separate living environments create social bubbles within the life of the inhabitants, which may or may not be desirable. Moreover, this individual unit system is low kinetic: the dynamics prescribed by a localized architecture (in terms of proximity of programs), is lower than, let’s say, alternative ways of living.`,
      `By challenging this conventional configuration of a solid-void relationship between the public and private space within each residential unit, an alternative way of living environment can be cultivated.`,
      `Through exploding and fragmenting the programs (i.e. by deliberately shifting the programs of one unit in relation to others), and re-organizing the configuration of these individual programs, the architecture can allow room for social interaction, that may have not been possible otherwise. For example, the architecture may lead to unusual interactions between categories of people who normally wouldn’t be able to directly interact with one another in the conventional sense.`,
      `Furthermore, by creating social spaces that double as utilitarian (such as common kitchen spaces, public baths, open living rooms, etc.), this idea of bumping into another member of this micro-community can be furthered. As noted above, conventional housing units are low dynamic in nature. They are almost inflexible to the changing social environments within the community. By providing the residents modular structures that can be added (both vertically and horizontally), subtracted, and moved, space can be generated according to the inhabitant’s needs.`,
      `The site-less nature of the project allows an exploration of a public/private solid-void relationship, through a formal aesthetic. By carving into these fantastical mountainous plinths, a more permanent public/private relationship can be designed, which differentiates itself from the extremely social dynamic life on the surface.`,
