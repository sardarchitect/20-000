     `American suburbanization has created an uneventful dystopia that lacks pedestrian anchorage, walk-ability, and social infrastructure. This car-dependent, eveloper-oriented sub-urbanization also creates spaces that economically disincentivizes lower-income housing, gives way to sprawl, and promotes longer commutes.`,
      `This project creates a disruption within the critiqued American suburbiaby introducing a society of “DIY Makers” similar to the type proposed by Adam Greenfield in Toward a New Political Economy of Matter. By providing tools for manufacturing within a spatial rule-set, this project predicts a new sub-urban typology for a community-based development.`,
      `This new form of urbanism stays cohesive and structured in form, yet becomes organic in behavior. The project speculates the introduction of markets, cafes, residential quarters, and employment opportunities, providing a re-densification of suburbia at a smaller scale.`,
