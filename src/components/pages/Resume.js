      <h1>CV</h1>
      <p>
        Raised in an artistic household, my childhood memories revolve around
        design and creativity — my father’s wood-shop, my mother’s painting
        studio, and my city’s unique architectural disposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my education, I realized that the architect holds a great
        agency in shaping social and cultural dynamics. My passion for
        philosophy, world-politics, rhetoric, and architectural pedagogy
        critically engages me with the work I pursue. I consider myself an
        open-minded, cooperative, and a highly motivated individual.
